I joined Memorisely's development team to build and enhance key features, including a Job Board with hundreds of use cases delivered in just a few months. Using TypeScript, Tailwind, and Next.js with server actions, forms, and validations, I focused on creating efficient and user-friendly solutions. I also shared best practices with the team to improve security, performance, and scalability, ensuring a more robust and maintainable application.
