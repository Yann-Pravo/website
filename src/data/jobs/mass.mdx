I joined the development team at Mass, an innovative cryptocurrency platform, with the mission to create and enhance the essential features of its web application.

My main role was to develop critical functionalities such as buy, sell, swap, and bridge between different cryptocurrencies. I was also responsible for assisting with backend tasks when needed.

- Used React.js, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS to create a smooth and responsive user interface.
- Assisted with backend development using Express, particularly for the integration and functionality of new features.
- Troubleshot bugs and optimized performance for an optimal user experience.
