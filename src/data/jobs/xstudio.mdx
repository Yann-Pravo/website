I am a fullstack developer at X-Studio, a collective of freelance experts united by a passion for web development. At X-Studio, we value autonomy and collaboration, empowering each member to grow while delivering high-quality projects to clients. We primarily work with cutting-edge technologies to build scalable, efficient web applications. Next.js, TypeScript and Tailwind are used on the front-end side of most apps who are deployed on Vercel. Prisma is here to manage and query our postegreSQL datatables stored on Supabase.

Our mission is to create a sustainable and collaborative freelancing environment that pushes the boundaries of independent work while ensuring success for both our clients and our team.
